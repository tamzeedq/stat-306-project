# Stat 306 Project
Motivated by our group’s curiosity and common interest in music, our research aims to explore and build a suitable model to examine the relationship between a song’s Spotify streaming number with its music and popularity classifications. Determining a song’s popularity by its stream volume, various research on this topic has found that songs tend to be more successful if they exhibit a more ‘party-like’ or ‘sad’ dynamic in comparison to songs that display ‘brightness’ or ‘happiness’ (Interiano et al, 2018). Similarly, our research will explore the following research question:

“Can we find an optimal model for predicting the number of Spotify streams of a song based on different song attributes?” 

In this exploratory study, we will focus on data extracted from Spotify in 2023 and apply a linear regression model for Spotify streams to attempt to determine what makes a song succeed in streaming volume during 2023. Our findings could be used to explain broader questions about the music industry and consumption.
